# BICAN Knowledge Graph Models

## Background 
The BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is developing an extensible Brain Cell Knowledge Base (BCKB) to ingest and standardize comprehensive cell type information from BICAN's development of a multimodal, multi-species brain cell atlas and disseminate that atlas as an open and interactive community resource for advancing knowledge of the brain. As the first part of the BCKB project, BICAN will create an adaptive Knowledge Graph for linking brain cell information. A flexible graph-based data model will capture discrete and continuous cell type relationships. The data models listed below are used to ingest data into the Knowledge Graph.

## Data Models
### 1. [Library Generation Model](index_library_generation.md)
### 2. [Anatomical Structure Reference Service (AnSRS) Model](index_ansrs.md)
### 3. [Genome Annotation Registry Service (GARS) Model](gars.md)
