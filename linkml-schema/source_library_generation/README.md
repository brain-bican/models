## Sources to build the library geenration model 

- Metadata from [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11OcQz1Vk3ofny3Ql7wN-XlHkZwub-hojt-fO094SxiI/edit?usp=sharing)
- All the sheets will be saved as tsv files in `gsheet_output`
- Current Google Sheet version saved at: `September 30, 9:04â€¯PM`
- The generated LinkML schema will be saved in `bkbit/models/library_generation_model.yaml`
- Additional information:
  - currently using `no-inlined` due to some issues with pydantic generation
  - currently using an older version of schemasheets due to issues with newer versions
