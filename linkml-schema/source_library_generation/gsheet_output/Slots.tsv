AmplifiedCdna	amplified cDNA label  	name	e2606a11-114e-472f-9e05-33f9b6fc3089	amplified cdna name	Name of a collection of cDNA molecules derived and amplified from an input barcoded_cell_sample.  These cDNA molecules represent the gene expression of each cell, with all cDNA molecules from a given cell retaining that cell's unique barcode from the cell barcoding step.  This is a necessary step for GEX methods but is not used for ATAC methods.	bican_biolink	TRUE		Text						analysis		Amplified cDNA	PD-YAAGGG39	amplified_cdna_local_name	NIMP
BarcodedCellSample	barcoded cell sample label 	name	4c0e6380-e53f-4173-a474-d41e836fefe3	barcoded cell sample name	Name of a collection of barcoded cells.  Input will be either dissociated_cell_sample or enriched_cell_sample.  Cell barcodes are only guaranteed to be unique within this one collection. One dissociated_cell_sample or enriched_cell_sample can lead to multiple barcoded_cell_samples.	bican_biolink	FALSE		Text						analysis, tracking, alignment		Barcoded Cell Sample	PD-XEMDJF38	barcoded_cell_sample_local_name	NIMP
BrainSlab		name			The identifier given to the slab by the brain bank.	bican_biolink											Slab	PD-WKWKFB34	slab_local_name	NIMP
DissectionRoiPolygon		name			Name of a polygon annotated on a brain slab image delineating a region of interest (ROI) for a tissue sample dissectioning.	bican_biolink											Specimen Dissected ROI		local_name	NIMP
DissociatedCellSample	dissociated cell sample label	name	65e2c7da-9eb4-45b2-8ccb-d69ef9785ee2	dissociated cell sample name	Name of a collection of dissociated cells or nuclei derived from dissociation of a tissue sample. 	bican_biolink	TRUE		Text						analysis		Dissociated Cell Sample	PD-RQRWHS40	dissociated_cell_sample_local_name	NIMP
Donor	subject_id	name	f8af20f7-e8b8-47b5-8a68-9ec1f913ffdf		Donor identifier given by the brain bank or the institution that holds the brain	bican_biolink											Donor		donor_local_name	NIMP
EnrichedCellSample	enriched cell sample name	name	bb3fc701-23a7-45c1-890d-7471730e0ec1		Name of collection of enriched cells or nuclei after enrichment process (usually via FACS using the Enrichment Plan) applied to dissociated_cell_sample.	bican_biolink	TRUE		Text						analysis		Enriched Cell Sample	PD-BERWTM41	enriched_cell_sample_local_name	NIMP
Library	library label	name	f717e254-3630-4342-be7b-4d56376e7afe	library name	Name of a library, which is a collection of fragmented and barcode-indexed DNA molecules for sequencing.  An index or barcode is typically introduced to enable identification of library origin to allow libraries to be pooled together for sequencing.	bican_biolink	TRUE		Text						analysis, tracking		Library	PD-AJJUCC35	library_local_name	NIMP
LibraryAliquot	library aliquot label	name	34191bad-d167-4335-8224-ade897d3728e	library aliquot name	One library in the library pool.  Each Library_aliquot_name in a library pool will have a unique R1/R2 index to allow for sequencing together then separating the sequencing output by originating library aliquot through the process of demultiplexing.  The resulting demultiplexed fastq files will include the library_aliquot_name.	bican_biolink	FALSE		Text						analysis, tracking, alignment		Library Aliquot	PD-XCXCCC35	library_aliquot_local_name	NIMP
LibraryPool	library pool label	name	29e0578b-6427-4c93-b29b-bde27fbadeec	local pool name	Library lab's library pool name.  For some labs this may be the same as "Libray pool tube local name".   Other labs distinguish between the local tube label of the library pool and the library pool name provided to SeqCore for tracking.  Local Pool Name is used to communicate sequencing status between SeqCore and Library Labs.	bican_biolink	FALSE		Text						analysis, tracking		Library Pool	PD-KKIAPA48	library_pool_local_name	NIMP
TissueSample	tissue sample label	name	2e4ca2fc-2d77-4d19-af45-d0fb7bbc2269	tissue name|tissue sample label	Identifier name for final intact piece of tissue before cell or nuclei prep.  This piece of tissue will be used in dissociation and has an ROI associated with it.	bican_biolink	FALSE		text						analysis, tracking		Tissue	PD-LJCRCC35	tissue_sample_local_name	NIMP
