TissueSample	2e4ca2fc-2d77-4d19-af45-d0fb7bbc2269	name	bican_biolink	tissue name|tissue sample label	Identifier name for final intact piece of tissue before cell or nuclei prep.  This piece of tissue will be used in dissociation and has an ROI associated with it.	tissue sample label	FALSE		text						analysis, tracking		Tissue	PD-LJCRCC35	tissue_sample_local_name	NIMP
AmplifiedCdna	e2606a11-114e-472f-9e05-33f9b6fc3089	name	bican_biolink	amplified cdna name	Name of a collection of cDNA molecules derived and amplified from an input barcoded_cell_sample.  These cDNA molecules represent the gene expression of each cell, with all cDNA molecules from a given cell retaining that cell's unique barcode from the cell barcoding step.  This is a necessary step for GEX methods but is not used for ATAC methods. 	amplified cDNA label  	TRUE		Text						analysis		Amplified cDNA	PD-YAAGGG39	amplified_cdna_local_name	NIMP
BarcodedCellSample	4c0e6380-e53f-4173-a474-d41e836fefe3	name	bican_biolink	barcoded cell sample name	Name of a collection of barcoded cells.  Input will be either dissociated_cell_sample or enriched_cell_sample.  Cell barcodes are only guaranteed to be unique within this one collection. One dissociated_cell_sample or enriched_cell_sample can lead to multiple barcoded_cell_samples.	barcoded cell sample label 	FALSE		Text						analysis, tracking, alignment		Barcoded Cell Sample	PD-XEMDJF38	barcoded_cell_sample_local_name	NIMP
DissociatedCellSample	65e2c7da-9eb4-45b2-8ccb-d69ef9785ee2	name	bican_biolink	dissociated cell sample name	Name of a collection of dissociated cells or nuclei derived from dissociation of a tissue sample. 	dissociated cell sample label	TRUE		Text						analysis		Dissociated Cell Sample	PD-RQRWHS40	dissociated_cell_sample_local_name	NIMP
EnrichedCellSample	bb3fc701-23a7-45c1-890d-7471730e0ec1	name	bican_biolink		Name of collection of enriched cells or nuclei after enrichment process (usually via FACS using the Enrichment Plan) applied to dissociated_cell_sample.	enriched cell sample name	TRUE		Text						analysis		Enriched Cell Sample	PD-BERWTM41	enriched_cell_sample_local_name	NIMP
Library	f717e254-3630-4342-be7b-4d56376e7afe	name	bican_biolink	library name	Name of a library, which is a collection of fragmented and barcode-indexed DNA molecules for sequencing.  An index or barcode is typically introduced to enable identification of library origin to allow libraries to be pooled together for sequencing.	library label	TRUE		Text						analysis, tracking		Library	PD-AJJUCC35	library_local_name	NIMP
LibraryAliquot	34191bad-d167-4335-8224-ade897d3728e	name	bican_biolink	library aliquot name	One library in the library pool.  Each Library_aliquot_name in a library pool will have a unique R1/R2 index to allow for sequencing together then separating the sequencing output by originating library aliquot through the process of demultiplexing.  The resulting demultiplexed fastq files will include the library_aliquot_name.	library aliquot label	FALSE		Text						analysis, tracking, alignment		Library Aliquot	PD-XCXCCC35	library_aliquot_local_name	NIMP
LibraryPool	29e0578b-6427-4c93-b29b-bde27fbadeec	name	bican_biolink	local pool name	Library lab's library pool name.  For some labs this may be the same as "Libray pool tube local name".   Other labs distinguish between the local tube label of the library pool and the library pool name provided to SeqCore for tracking.  Local Pool Name is used to communicate sequencing status between SeqCore and Library Labs.	library pool label	FALSE		Text						analysis, tracking		Library Pool	PD-KKIAPA48	library_pool_local_name	NIMP
Donor		name	bican_biolink		Name of person or organism that is the source of a biological sample for scientific study.  Many biological samples are generated from a single donor.												Donor		donor_local_id	NIMP
BrainSlab		name	bican_biolink		Name of a thick flat piece of brain tissue obtained by slicing a whole brain, brain hemisphere or subdivision with a blade at regular interval.  When multiple brain slabs are obtained from the slicing process, an ordinal is assigned to provide information about the relative positioning of the slabs.												Slab		local_name	NIMP
DissectionRoiPolygon		name	bican_biolink		Name of a polygon annotated on a brain slab image delineating a region of interest (ROI) for a tissue sample dissectioning.												Specimen Dissected ROI		local_name	NIMP
