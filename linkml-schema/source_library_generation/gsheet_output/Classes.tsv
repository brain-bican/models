Donor	physical entity	thing with taxon|ProvEntity			A person or organism that is the source of a biological sample for scientific study.  Many biological samples are generated from a single donor.	Donor	aibs:lims:donors	
BrainSlab	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|tissue_specimen	A thick flat piece of brain tissue obtained by slicing a whole brain, brain hemisphere or subdivision with a blade at regular interval.  When multiple brain slabs are obtained from the slicing process, an ordinal is assigned to provide information about the relative positioning of the slabs.	Slab	aibs:lims:specimens	
TissueSample	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	The final intact piece of tissue before cell or nuclei prep. This piece of tissue will be used in dissociation and has an region of interest polygon (ROI) associated with it.	Tissue	aibs:lims:specimens	aibs:lims:cell_prep_roi_plans
DissociatedCellSample	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	A collection of dissociated cells or nuclei derived from dissociation of a tissue sample.	Dissociated Cell Sample	aibs:lims:cell_prep_samples	
EnrichedCellSample	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	A collection of enriched cells or nuclei after enrichment process, usually via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the enrichment plan, is applied to dissociated cell sample.	Enriched Cell Sample	aibs:lims:facs_well_templates	
BarcodedCellSample	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	A collection of molecularly barcoded cells. Input will be either dissociated cell sample or enriched cell sample. Cell barcodes are only guaranteed to be unique within this one collection. One dissociated cell sample or enriched cell sample can lead to multiple barcoded cell samples.  The sequences of the molecular barcodes are revealed during alignment of the resulting fastq files for the barcoded cell sample. The barcoded cell sample name and the cell level molecular barcode together uniquely identify a single cell.	Barcoded Cell Sample	aibs:lims:rna_amplifications	
AmplifiedCdna	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	A collection of cDNA molecules derived and amplified from an input barcoded cell sample. These cDNA molecules represent the gene expression of each cell, with all cDNA molecules from a given cell retaining that cell's unique barcode from the cell barcoding step. This is a necessary step for GEX methods but is not used for ATAC methods.	Amplified cDNA	aibs:lims:rna_amplifications	
Library	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	A collection of fragmented and barcode-indexed DNA molecules for sequencing. An index or barcode is typically introduced to enable identification of library origin to allow libraries to be pooled together for sequencing.	Library	aibs:lims:rseq_library_preps	
LibraryAliquot	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	One library in the library pool. Each library aliquot in a library pool will have a unique R1/R2 index to allow for sequencing together then separating the sequencing output by originating library aliquot through the process of demultiplexing. The resulting demultiplexed fastq files will include the library aliquot name.  A given library may produce multiple library aliquots, which is done in the case of resequencing.  Each library aliquot will produce a set of fastq files.	Library Aliquot	aibs:lims:rseq_experiment_components	
LibraryPool	material sample	ProvEntity		bican|library_generation	A library pool is made up of library aliquots from multiple libraries. Each library aliquot in a library pool will have a unique R1/R2 index to allow for sequencing together then separating the sequencing output by originating library aliquot through the process of demultiplexing.	Library Pool	aibs:lims:rseq_tubes	
DissectionRoiDelineation	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of outlining a region of interest on a brain slab image to guide the dissection and generation of a tissue sample.			
TissueDissection	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of dissecting a tissue sample from a brain slab guided by a dissection region of interest (ROI) delineation.			
CellDissociation	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of generating dissociated cells from an input tissue sample. This process could also introduce a tissue-source barcode (eg cell hashing), allowing mixing of cell dissociation samples at the cell barcoding step.			
CellEnrichment	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of enriching a dissociated cell sample by including or excluding cells of different types based on an enrichment plan using techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This process could also introduce a tissue-source barcode (eg cell hashing), allowing mixing of cell enriched samples at the cell barcoding step.			
EnrichedCellSampleSplitting	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of splitting an enriched cell sample into several portions. Each portion may be used by the same or different groups for different scientific studies.			
CellBarcoding	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of adding a molecular barcode to individual cells in a sample. The input will be either dissociated cell sample or enriched cell sample. Cell barcodes are only guaranteed to be unique within this one collection. One dissociated cell sample or enriched cell sample can lead to multiple barcoded cell samples.			
CdnaAmplification	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of creating a collection of cDNA molecules derived and amplified from an input barcoded cell sample.  A large amount of cDNA is needed to have accurate and reliable sequencing detection of gene expression.  This process generates multiple copies of each mRNA transcript (expressed gene) within each cell while retaining the cell's unique barcode from the barcoding step. This is a necessary step for GEX methods but is not used for ATAC methods.			
LibraryConstruction	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of constructing a library from input material (such as amplified cDNA or barcoded cell sample) derived from one or more cell samples.  cDNA is fragmented into smaller pieces appropriate for sequencing and at the same time a library index barcode is incorporated to enable identification of library origin, allowing libraries to be pooled together for sequencing.			
LibraryPooling	procedure	ProvActivity		bican|library_generation	The process of constructing of a libray pool by combining library aliquots from a set of input libraries. Each library aliquot in a library pool will have a unique R1/R2 index to allow for sequencing together then separating the sequencing output by originating library aliquot through the process of demultiplexing.
