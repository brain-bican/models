      A parcellation terminology is a versioned release set of terms that can be used to label

      about brain locations and structural properties. Typically, a terminology is a set of 
      descriptive anatomical terms following a specific naming convention and/or approach to 
      organization scheme. The terminology may be a flat list of controlled vocabulary, a taxonomy 
      and partonomy, or an ontology (ref: ILX:0777107, RRID:SCR_023499)

      A parcellation term set belongs to one and only one parcellation terminology and each parcellation 
      term in a parcellation terminology belongs to one and only one term set. 
      If the parcellation terminology is a taxonomy, parcellation term sets can be used to represent 
      taxonomic ranks. For consistency, if the terminology does not have the notion of taxonomic ranks, 
      all terms are grouped into a single parcellation term set.

      A parcellation term is an individual term within a specific parcellation terminology describing a

      term is a unique and exclusive member of a versioned release parcellation terminology. Although term 
      identifiers must be unique within the context of one versioned release of a parcellation terminology, 
      they can be reused in different parcellation terminology versions enabling the representation of 
      terminology updates and modifications over time.

      parcellation terminology or its related parcellation annotation. A parcellation terminology may 
      have zero or more parcellation color schemes and each color scheme is in context of a specific 
      parcellation terminology, where each parcellation term is assigned a hex color value. A parcellation 
      color scheme is defined as a part of one and only one parcellation terminology.

  AnatomicalAnnotationSet:

    description: >-
      An anatomical annotation set is a versioned release of a set of anatomical annotations anchored 
      in the same anatomical space that divides the space into distinct segments following some annotation 
      criteria or parcellation scheme. For example, the anatomical annotation set of 3D image based 
      reference atlases (e.g. Allen Mouse CCF) can be expressed as a set of label indices of single 
      multi-valued image annotations or as a set of segmentation masks (ref: ILX:0777108, RRID:SCR_023499)

  ParcellationAnnotation:
    description: >-
      A parcellation annotation defines a specific segment of an anatomical space denoted by an internal 
      identifier and is a unique and exclusive member of a versioned release anatomical annotation set. 
      For example, in the case where the anatomical annotation set is a single multi-value image mask (e.g. Allen Mouse CCF),
      a specific annotation corresponds to a specific label index (internal identifier) in the mask.

  ParcellationAnnotationTermMap:
    description: >-
      The parcellation annotation term map table defines the relationship between parcellation annotations and parcellation terms. 
      A parcellation term is uniquely denoted by a parcellation term identifier and the parcellation terminology it belongs to. 
      A parcellation term can be spatially parameterized by the union of one or more parcellation annotations within a versioned 
      release of an anatomical annotation set. For example, annotations defining individual cortical layers in cortical region 
      R (R1, R2/3, R4, etc) can be combined to define the parent region R.

  ParcellationAtlas:

    description: >-
      A parcellation atlas is a versioned release reference used to guide experiments or deal with the spatial relationship between 
      objects or the location of objects within the context of some anatomical structure. An atlas is minimally defined by a notion 
      of space (either implicit or explicit) and an annotation set. Reference atlases usually have additional parts that make them 
      more useful in certain situations, such as a well defined coordinate system, delineations indicating the boundaries of various 
      regions or cell populations, landmarks, and labels and names to make it easier to communicate about well known and useful 
      locations (ref: ILX:0777109, RRID:SCR_023499).
